# AIKIDO - AI for KIDO

> :warning: **Warning:** AIKIDO is under heavy development. These instructions are
> primarily for reference by the developers.

AIKIDO is a C++ library, complete with Python bindings, for solving robotic motion
planning and decision making problems. This library is tightly integrated with
[DART] for kinematic/dynamics calculations and [OMPL] for motion planning. AIKIDO
optionally integrates with [ROS], through the suite of `aikido_ros` packages, for
execution on real robots.

### Dependencies
AIKIDO depends on [CMake], [Boost], [DART] \(version 5.0 or above), [OMPL], and the
Python development headers (`python-dev` on Debian systems). [DART] and AIKIDO both
make heavy use of C++11 and require a modern compiler.

### Installation (Standalone)
Once the dependencies are installed, you can build AIKIDO using [CMake]:
```shell
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ..
$ make
$ sudo make install
```

### Installation (Catkin)
It is also possible to build AIKIDO as a [third-party package][REP-136] inside a
[Catkin workspace][Catkin Workspaces]. To do so, clone AIKIDO into your Catkin
workspace and use the `catkin build` command like normal.

If you are using the older `catkin_make` command, then you must build your workspace
with `catkin_make_isolated`. This may dramatically increase your build time, so we
*strongly recommend* that you use `catkin build`, which is provided by the
[`catkin_tools` package][Catkin Tools], if possible.
