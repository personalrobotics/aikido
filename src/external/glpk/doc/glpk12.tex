\chapter{External Software Modules Used In GLPK}

In the GLPK package there are used some external software modules
listed in this Appendix. Note that these modules are {\it not} part of
GLPK, but are used with GLPK and included in the distribution.

\section{AMD}

AMD Version 2.2, Copyright {\copyright} 2007 by Timothy A. Davis,
Patrick R. Amestoy, and Iain S. Duff.  All Rights Reserved.

\subsection*{Description}

AMD is a set of routines for pre-ordering sparse matrices prior to
Cholesky or LU factorization, using the approximate minimum degree
ordering algorithm.

\section{COLAMD/SYMAMD}

COLAMD/SYMAMD Version 2.7, Copyright {\copyright} 1998-2007, Timothy A.
Davis, All Rights Reserved.

\subsection*{Description}

\paragraph{colamd:} an approximate minimum degree column ordering
algorithm, for LU factorization of symmetric or unsymmetric matrices,
QR factorization, least squares, interior point methods for linear
programming problems, and other related problems.

\paragraph{symamd:} an approximate minimum degree ordering algorithm
for Cholesky factorization of symmetric matrices.

\subsection*{Authors}

The authors of the code itself are Stefan I. Larimore and Timothy A.
Davis (davis at cise.ufl.edu), University of Florida.  The algorithm
was developed in collaboration with John Gilbert, Xerox PARC, and
Esmond Ng, Oak Ridge National Laboratory.
